# wikiViewer

A simple application that uses the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to generate relevant Wiki articles based on a search term.

Also provides a random wikipedia page.

Some error handling has been implemented to handle:
* Blank entries
* No matches for search term

Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
